## FakePro -Fake Product Detection Using Blockchain
  Problem:- There are many fake products existing in supply chain and to ensure genuineness of products system is needed. To check genuineness of product Ownership history of the product need to be maintain.
  
  Solution:-   1.system provides reliable and secure product transaction history using blockchain.
 POMS in SCM using consensus algorithm.
 2.In proposed system the manufacturer will enroll him with valid information on the blockchain with company name and other details and assigns a unique ID to each product with QR code. 
3.The manufacturer ships products to the Distributor where a distributor can check the manufacturer details and ownership of the products, etc. Distributor verifies the genuineness of the EPC using assigned QR code and issues a transaction.

## Tech Stack /Tools:-
1.Remix IDE -
Remix IDE is an open-source web and desktop application. It fosters a fast development cycle and has a rich set of plugins with intuitive GUIs. The remix is used for the entire journey of contract development as well as being a playground for learning and teaching Ethereum.

2. Ethereum node:
Ethereum is a distributed network of computers running software (known as nodes) that can verify blocks and transaction data. 


3. Meta mask:
Meta Mask allows users to sign smart contracts and interface with Ethereum dApps (distributed Ethereum-based applications) without running a full Ethereum node


4. PHP :
For Developing the backedn we have use the PHP


5. MySQL:
For Storing the user username and password info used MySQL with Wamp Server .Password will stored in encrypted format.

6. Ganache:
Ganache is a personal blockchain for rapid Ethereum and Corda distributed application development. Ganache is used for setting up a personal Ethereum Blockchain for testing your Solidity contracts. It provides more features when compared to Remix. 

6.Solidity :
For Smart Contract Development.
